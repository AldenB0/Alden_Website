                  the transitionary process from their old EHR system to the new

                In conclusion, the mCODE coverage checker project has been an
                incredibly meaningful journey for me, as it offered a unique
                opportunity to navigate the entire UX process independently.
                From design to research and user testing, I was able to take
                ownership of every decision and aspect of the project. This
                autonomy allowed me to make mistakes and learn from them in
                invaluable ways, contributing to my growth as a designer.
                <br /> <br />
                Furthermore, being actively involved in both the design and
                development aspects of the project provided me with a
                comprehensive understanding of the hand-off process. Witnessing
                firsthand how designs are translated into a functional product
                enabled me to identify potential friction points and
                inefficiencies, strengthening my appreciation for the necessary
                collaboration between designers and developers. This newfound
                insight has equipped me to create more seamless and cohesive
                experiences in future projects, benefiting both sides of the
                hand-off.
                <br /> <br />I am grateful for the opportunity to have taken
                this project from inception to completion, as it has deepened my
                passion for creating meaningful and user-centric solutions. The
                sense of ownership and accomplishment derived from working on an
                open-source health product has amplified the significance of my
                contribution. This experience has not only enriched my
                professional skills but has also left a lasting personal impact,
                solidifying my commitment to pursuing impactful UX design work.
