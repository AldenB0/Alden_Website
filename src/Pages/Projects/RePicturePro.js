                Our stakeholders came to us to continue the work on redesigning
                their website, which was started a year ago by another capstone
                group. While last year's group focused on building a design
                system and home pages, our task was to continue the design
                process for the pages untouched by the last group and, more

                This project taught me the importance of{" "}
                <strong>understanding your audience </strong> at a deep level
                and how to weave that understanding into what you create
                throughout the design process. This is crucial because in
                projects like this, where the bulk of the aesthetic design work
                has been done for you, the need to problem-solve on behalf of
                the audience you are designing for becomes front and center. Due
                to this, it was quite a complex and exciting challenge to take
                on. However, I was confident in our ability because I knew that
                our team was comprised of people who were willing to communicate
                often and were never afraid to ask for help. This proved to be
                an invaluable quality throughout this project and made me
                realize how important a comfortable and organized working
                environment is to a project's success. I am so thankful to have
                had a team that was so hardworking and great to collaborate
                with.
